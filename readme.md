# AWS Capacity Report handler
This tool must help AWS metrics reports generation to performance analysis.
#### Building report manually
**Now days** this is done daily and manually, day-by-day:

AWS metrics dashboard CPU and Memory data as CSV reports are formatted: numbers fixed and business period filtered. So data is pasted into a sheet with instances label as header, when all days of the week are completed, the week report is compiled with day's data.  

# Development context
Recently changed into DevOps, the report to be improved is used by our leader to keep track of our server's instances performance metrics,

# Running the project
---
With **nodeJS** installed, execute the commands:
- To install dependencies `` npm install ``
- Then run with `` npm start `` after set directories to **raw CSV files**, metadata - `MetricsByDashboardName` map and `AWSDetails` to **outputReport**.
   !! Theses paths are hard coded for now !!

## How does it work?
Data from CSV file is treated, filtered by business work time and grouped by day - *week data processing to be developed*
- Simplistic sequence diagram of data flow. Async methods to return data within these shown methods need to be improved.

| Class | Functionally |
| --- |     ---    |
`Queue` | Read raw files directory to get files queue. |
`AWS File Handler` | Process data from CSV and format into treated data to report generation. |
| `AWS Metrics Controller` | Controls the workflow: **Files on queue** > Get **environment Metadata** > **Process and format CSV** to get metrics data > **Build/update XLSX reports**
| `Report` | Generate the output XLSX from metrics `formattedData`

ðŸ“Œ I'm trying to improve tasks/development tracking, also mapping identified **technical debts** to further improvements.
Change logs bellow is an overview to development workflow changes so far.

## Change Logs

---
#### **â†’ 27 Jan 2023**
-  Created `readme.md` with project details and **change logs**.
#### **â†’ 26 Jan 2023**
-  Improving data structures, isolating types.
-  Mapped dashboards name and its specificities.
-  Fixed instance metadata handling.
#### **â†’ 25 Jan 2023**
Async data was fixed, improving formatted data and  data structures.
To fix some technical debts from data fetching Promises.
-  Creating remote repository
#### **â†’ 23 Jan 2023**
Created **AWS Metrics Report Controller** which basically is instantiated by main script and runs the workflows:
â†’ Map metrics from files on queue and generate reports from grouped data   - Created `InstancesMetadataHelper` â†’ Attempts to fetch AWS instances details with AWS SDK because instances IDs on CSV files don't match with XLSX .
- Improving async calls on workflow, so metrics data can be mapped with instances label. Some issues dealing async calls on dataflow


- `AWSFileHandler` â†’ Improved getters to header, region and content from raw data.
#### **â†’ 20 Jan 2023**
Refactoring structures to isolate responsibilities. Treating async calls errors and types conflicts.
-  Created **Classes diagram** and **Data structures** to ease visualization.
#### **â†’ 18 Jan 2023**
Some CSV file handling was abstracted and `MetricsCSVFile` is `AWSFileHandler`, handling data and formatting day props. Improved methods of typing.
- Attempts to fetch AWS metrics details with AWS SDK


- Working on AWS instances metadata getter. It will be used to identify metric specificity. Attempting to map instances from the XLSM report given.
#### **â†’ 17 Jan 2023**
Converted elements to a rough class, intend to clean **process work** from **data structures.** Having trouble with async requests to read raw CSV reports. When `Metric` is passed to report generation, it still doesnâ€™t have data to be formatted.
#### **â†’ 16 Jan 2023**
Converting code to typescript usage to use type hints and study more about its usage.
Create `Queue` & `Report` handlers, and `MetricsCSVFile` to read, process and return formatted data.
